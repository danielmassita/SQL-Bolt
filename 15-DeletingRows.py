SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows
When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a DELETE statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause.

Delete statement with condition
DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition;
If you decide to leave out the WHERE constraint, then all rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional).

Taking extra care
Like the UPDATE statement from last lesson, it's recommended that you run the constraint in a SELECT query first to ensure that you are removing the right rows. Without a proper backup or test database, it is downright easy to irrevocably remove data, so always read your DELETE statements twice and execute once.
