SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (Pt. 2)
When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. We show a few common text-data specific operators below:

Operator	Condition	Example
=	Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	col_name = "abc"
!= or <>	Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	col_name != "abcd"
LIKE	Case insensitive exact string comparison	col_name LIKE "ABC"
NOT LIKE	Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"
%	Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	col_name LIKE "%AT%"
(matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS")
_	Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	col_name LIKE "AN_"
(matches "AND", but not "AN")
IN (…)	String exists in a list	col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")
NOT IN (…)	String does not exist in a list	col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")
Did you know?
All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords.

We should note that while most database implementations are quite efficient when using these operators, full-text search is best left to dedicated libraries like Apache Lucene or Sphinx. These libraries are designed specifically to do full text search, and as a result are more efficient and can support a wider variety of search features including internationalization and advanced queries.

Exercise
Here's the definition of a query with a WHERE clause again, go ahead and try and write some queries with the operators above to limit the results to the information we need in the tasks below.
"""
Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
"""    
Exercise 3 — Tasks
Find all the Toy Story movies
Find all the movies directed by John Lasseter
Find all the movies (and director) not directed by John Lasseter
Find all the WALL-* movies
"""
SELECT * FROM movies;

SELECT * 
FROM Movies
WHERE Title
    LIKE '%toy story%';
  
SELECT Title, Director 
FROM Movies
WHERE Director
    LIKE '%John%';
  
SELECT Title, Director 
FROM Movies
WHERE Director
    NOT LIKE '%John Lasseter%';
  
SELECT * 
FROM Movies
WHERE Title
    LIKE '%wall%';
