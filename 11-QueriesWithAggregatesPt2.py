"""
Our queries are getting fairly complex, but we have nearly introduced all the important parts of a SELECT query. One thing that you might have noticed is that if the GROUP BY clause is executed after the WHERE clause (which filters the rows which are to be grouped), then how exactly do we filter the grouped rows?

Luckily, SQL allows us to do this by adding an additional HAVING clause which is used specifically with the GROUP BY clause to allow us to filter grouped rows from the result set.

# Select query with HAVING constraint
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
