SQL Lesson 18: Dropping tables
In some rare cases, you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, and to do so, you can use the DROP TABLE statement, which differs from the DELETE statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.

Drop table statement
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;
Like the CREATE TABLE statement, the database may throw an error if the specified table does not exist, and to suppress that error, you can use the IF EXISTS clause.

In addition, if you have another table that is dependent on columns in table you are removing (for example, with a FOREIGN KEY dependency) then you will have to either update all dependent tables first to remove the dependent rows or to remove those tables entirely.

Exercise 18 â€” Tasks
We've sadly reached the end of our lessons, lets clean up by removing the Movies table
And drop the BoxOffice table as well
