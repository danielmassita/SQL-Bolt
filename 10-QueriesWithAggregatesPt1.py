"""
In addition to the simple expressions that we introduced last lesson, SQL also supports the use of aggregate expressions (or functions) that allow you to summarize information about a group of rows of data. With the Pixar database that you've been using, aggregate functions can be used to answer questions like, "How many movies has Pixar produced?", or "What is the highest grossing Pixar film each year?".
"""
# Select query with aggregate functions over all rows
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression) AS aggregate_description, …
FROM mytable
WHERE constraint_expression;
"""
Without a specified grouping, each aggregate function is going to run on the whole set of result rows and return a single value. And like normal expressions, giving your aggregate functions an alias ensures that the results will be easier to read and process.

Common aggregate functions
Here are some common aggregate functions that we are going to use in our examples:

Function	Description
COUNT(*), COUNT(column)	A common function used to counts the number of rows in the group if no column name is specified. Otherwise, count the number of rows in the group with non-NULL values in the specified column.
MIN(column)	Finds the smallest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.
MAX(column)	Finds the largest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.
AVG(column)	Finds the average numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.
SUM(column)	Finds the sum of all numerical values in the specified column for the rows in the group.

Docs: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server

Grouped aggregate functions
In addition to aggregating across all the rows, you can instead apply the aggregate functions to individual groups of data within that group (ie. box office sales for Comedies vs Action movies).
This would then create as many results as there are unique groups defined as by the GROUP BY clause.
"""
# Select query with aggregate functions over groups
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression) AS aggregate_description, …
FROM mytable
WHERE constraint_expression
GROUP BY column;
"""
The GROUP BY clause works by grouping rows that have the same value in the column specified.

Exercise
For this exercise, we are going to work with our Employees table. Notice how the rows in this table have shared data, which will give us an opportunity to use aggregate functions to summarize some high-level metrics about the teams. Go ahead and give it a shot.

Exercise 10 — Tasks
Find the longest time that an employee has been at the studio
For each role, find the average number of years employed by employees in that role
Find the total number of employee years worked in each building

Table: Employees
Role	Name	Building	Years_employed
Engineer	Becky A.	1e	4
Engineer	Dan B.	1e	2
Engineer	Sharon F.	1e	6
Engineer	Dan M.	1e	4
Engineer	Malcom S.	1e	1
Artist	Tylar S.	2w	2
Artist	Sherman D.	2w	8
Artist	Jakob J.	2w	6
Artist	Lillia A.	2w	7
Artist	Brandon J.	2w	7
Manager	Scott K.	1e	9
Manager	Shirlee M.	1e	3
Manager	Daria O.	2w	6
